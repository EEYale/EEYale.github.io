# Earth Engine @ Yale

We are a group of researchers and students at Yale using Google Earth Engine. We meet every week to work on scripts and share ideas. In collaboration with Prof. Dana Tomlin's [Geospatial Software Design](https://environment.yale.edu/courses/2017-2018/detail/754/) class, this group aims to provide a space for mentorship and developing resources that will be useful to the broader Earth Engine user community.
