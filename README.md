## Earth Engine @ Yale

We are a group of students, researchers and developers at Yale using [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com) for spatial analysis on a wide range of topics. We meet weekly to share ideas, troubleshoot and work on code in the same space. In collaboration with Prof. Dana Tomlin's [Geospatial Software Design](https://environment.yale.edu/courses/2018-2019/detail/754/) class, this group aims to provide a space for mentorship and developing resources that will be useful to the broader Earth Engine user community.

## Join us!
Our weekly meetings are on Mondays from 4 to 5pm. 

Our two meeting venues are the the [Yale Center for Earth Observations](https://yceo.yale.edu) lab on 21 Sachem as well as the [Ucross High Plains Stewardship Initiative office](http://highplainsstewardship.org/) at Sage Hall Room 8A at 205 Prospect St. It is located on the ground floor at the end of the corridor (under Bowers auditorium). Please check the weekly schedule below for the location of that week's meeting.
